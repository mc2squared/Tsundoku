# Tsundoku
## 積ん読 -"The act of acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them."
Tsundoku is a Book Management suite of scripts written in Bash, heavily inspired by [na-- 's ebook-tools](https://github.com/na--/ebook-tools), meant for those who download/manage thousands of eBooks but need organization while being free from any certain ecosystem. Not many programs exist for the purpose, and very few do it well. Primarily this is a tool built for myself (as I've got 15TB of ebooks...), but it's only right to share this with the world. 

## (upcoming) Features:
- Metadata via ISBN
- Human-readable Database
- Optical Character Recognition
- Corruption Checks
- (optionally) Format Conversion/Format Sanitization
